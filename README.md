# Using Machine Learning to Predict WAR for MLB Pitchers

This project is an exploration into the world of baseball analytics, focusing on predicting Wins Above Replacement (WAR) for MLB players. It leverages historical player performance data to project future contributions using machine learning techniques.

## Description

In this project, we delve into the application of data science within the realm of baseball, one of America's most data-rich sports. By analyzing player statistics, we attempt to forecast their future impact on the team's success, measured in terms of WAR. The goal is to assist teams in making informed decisions regarding player acquisitions and game strategy, maximizing performance while managing resources efficiently.
